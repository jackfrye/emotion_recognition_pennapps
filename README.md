Emotion Recognition

This application uses a Raspberry Pi and associated camera module to take image data and send it to Amazon Recognition API to detect emotion of those seen. This data is then transfered to a mobile application for the user's convenience.
To run python web_server.py, search for the pis ip address using ifconfig and use any internet browser connected on the same network as the pi to visualize responses
